### Rust Robotics ToolKit: A set of algorithms and code structures for robotics in Rust.

It does not currently integrate with any API directly, but this may be added in the future.

#### Available:
- PID controller
- Motor and encoder control system
- Trapezoidal motion profile

#### Future:
- Stream system
- Motion physics simulation
- Jerk control
- - S-curve motion profile
- Drive base control
- - Spline-based path planning
- Noise filtering
